Idea behind shrinkage: When white noise is added to the data then all Fourier coefficients
are increased by a constant on average. ⇒ Shrink all coefficients by the estimated noise
amount to derive a robust predictor.

(We must respect noise in this problem since it is very similar to the cancer example)

Kernel engineering is important in many domains!
It allows us to flexibly model machine learning solutions for various data types like
strings, graphs, trees, lists, etc., when algorithms depend only on scalar products
